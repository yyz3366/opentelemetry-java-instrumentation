/**
 * A utility to track nested calls in an instrumentation.
 *
 * <p>For example, this can be used to track nested calls to {@code super()} in constructors by
 * calling {@link #getAndIncrement()} at the beginning of each constructor.
 *
 * <p>This works the following way: when you enter some method that you want to track, you call
 * {@link #getAndIncrement()} method. If returned number is larger than 0, then you have already
 * been in this method and are in recursive call now. When you then leave the method, you call
 * {@link #decrementAndGet()} method. If returned number is larger than 0, then you have already
 * been in this method and are in recursive call now.
 *
 * <p>In short, the semantic of both methods is the same: they will return value 0 if and only if
 * current method invocation is the first one for the current call stack.
